Topic Modeling Using a Dataset of BBC News Articles
---------------------------------------------------
The "bbc-dataset-201601-201607-time.tab" dataset that was used is available at the URL   
https://github.com/BBC-News-Labs/Text_Analytics/tree/master/data-from-Juicer  

The goal of the project was to create a visualization tool to provide insight into the distribution of relevant topics in a dataset of BBC news, with respect to geographic area. In order to do so, Natural Language Processing tools have been applied to carry out the following tasks:
- Preprocessing of 36,163 text documents using tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and n-gram extraction
- Creation of topic models using Latent Dirichlet Allocation 
- Automatic annotation of topics   

In order to allow for an easier exploration of the results, a visualization tool has been developed, showing the distribution of topics across UK regions using Google Fusion Tables. This tool allows also the user to incorporate filters, so that specific topics or geographic regions can be better analyzed and compared.
